This repository houses code for a population registry system developed as part of the Inzynieria Oprogramowania (Software Engineering) Laboratory classes at Politechnika Wroclawska (Wroclaw University of Science and Technology), led by Jan Magott. The code encompasses application classes handling population management and associated functionalities, along with unit test classes ensuring the robustness and accuracy of the implemented features. This project serves as a practical application of software engineering principles, hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and testing a population registry system.
